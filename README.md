Fabrication:
For this device, you’ll need a raspberry pi, a photoresistor, a temperature and humidity sensor, a button, a microphone, and an LED. Once the pieces of the house have been laser cut (on 1/16” chipboard), you can begin assembling the house (hot glue may be required). First put together the four side walls (the two pentagons and the two rectangle pieces). Then, attach the bottom piece (the square with four outward extensions). At this point, you can also glue a piece of tracing paper over the windows inside the house. The microphone should be taped to the underside of the roof piece so that it can be seen through the hole from the outside. The photoresistor should be taped in a similar fashion to the underside of the second roof piece. The temperature and humidity sensor should be secured in the rectangular hole in the side walls. The breadboard with the button, resistor, and additional external wires should be wired through the hole in the side wall so that it is outside the house. The raspberry pi board should be placed inside the house. To complete the house, place the two roof pieces on top.
