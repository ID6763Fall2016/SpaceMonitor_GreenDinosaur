##Fabrication:
####For this device, youâ€™ll need... 
* a raspberry pi
* a photoresistor
* a temperature and humidity sensor
* a button
* a microphone
* an LED

####Assembly 
1. Laser cut the pieces of the house template on 1/16" chipboard.
2. Use hot glue to put together the four side walls.
  * the two pentagons and the two rectangle pieces
3. Glue the bottom piece to the four walls.
  * the bottom piece is the square with four outward extensions
4. Glue a piece of tracing paper over the windows inside the house. 
5. Tape the microphone to the underside of the roof piece so that it can be seen through the hole from the outside. 
  * the roof pieces are the rounded rectangles with holes in the middle
6. Like in the previous step, the photoresistor should be taped to the underside of the second roof piece. 
7. Secure the temperature and humidity sensor in the rectangular hole in the side walls. 
8. Wire the breadboard with the button, resistor, and additional external wires through the hole in the side wall so that they are outside the house. 
9. Place the raspberry pi inside the house. 
10. Finally, play the two roof pieces on top of the house.
